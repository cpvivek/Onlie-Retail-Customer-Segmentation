# Online-Retail-Customer-Segmentation
# Introduction
With the evolution of marketing techniques, firms are now able to reach a much wider audience than ever before. But it’s not practical to spend their efforts on this wide population uniformly. One needs to identify the segment of the customer base and how these segments are responding to the product/service. Only then would one be able to take adequate measures and receive a better response from their customers. This is what we call customer segmentation.
Here I’ll develop an Unsupervised ML Clustering model to segment the customers of an online retail store to help them understand their customer base better.
